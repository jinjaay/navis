   - What to do and why it's worth the time
   - Approximate duration at each stop
   - How to get to the next stop (walking time, transit line, or taxi estimate)
   - One backup option in case it's closed or too crowded

2. OPENING HOURS & TIMING: Flag any spots with tricky hours (closed certain days, seasonal hours, ticket-only entry). Suggest the best arrival time to avoid crowds.

3. NEIGHBORHOOD FLOW: Group activities by neighborhood so I'm not zigzagging across the city. Explain the logical flow.

4. MEALS: Suggest specific meal spots (or street food areas) that fit naturally into the route. Include what they're known for.

5. EVENING OPTIONS: For each night, suggest 2 options (one low-key, one more active) based on energy levels after a full day.

6. PACKING SHORTLIST: 3–5 items specific to this destination and season that most travelers forget.

Format the plan so I can screenshot each day and use it as a walking guide.

For every specific place you recommend, include one way I can verify it's still open/accurate (e.g. Google Maps search term, official website, or "search for [X] on [platform]").`,

   - Transit/walking between stops
   - Meal recommendations that fit the route
   - One "local secret" that most tourists miss in that area

3. MUST-SEE vs SKIP: List the top attractions and honestly assess which are worth the hype and which are overrated tourist traps. Suggest what to do instead.

4. PRACTICAL LOGISTICS:
   - Best transit pass or card to buy
   - SIM/eSIM recommendation
   - Cash vs card norms
   - Key phrases in the local language
   - Safety notes specific to this city

2. MUST-EAT DISHES: List the 8–10 dishes I absolutely must try, ranked by priority. For each: what it is, where to get the best version, and approximate cost.

3. MEAL MAP (by day): For each day, suggest:
   - Breakfast spot (with specific recommendation)
   - Lunch spot
   - Afternoon snack / cafe
   - Dinner spot
   - Late-night option (if the city has a late food culture)
   Group meals by neighborhood to minimize travel between eating.

5. ORDERING CHEAT SHEET: Key food vocabulary, how to order at stalls/markets, pointing protocol, and payment norms.

6. FOOD EXPERIENCES: 2–3 food experiences beyond restaurants (cooking class, market tour, farm visit, food-focused neighborhood walk).

2. TRUE COST: Go beyond sticker price. Factor in transport costs (is Option B cheap but far?), included amenities, cancellation risk, and time cost.

3. PRIORITY-WEIGHTED ANALYSIS: Score each option on MY stated priorities. Weight the scores — not everything matters equally.

4. SCENARIO TEST: "Choose A if ___" and "Choose B if ___" — give me the conditions where each option wins.

5. WHAT I'D MISS: For each option, what's the biggest thing I'd give up by choosing the other?

6. RECOMMENDATION: Make a clear call for my situation, with one caveat that would flip the decision.`,
